Bottles	 of	 Beer”	 song.	 Through	 this	 exercise,	 you	 will	 enhance	 your java
programing skills	 further	 including GIT	 version control	 and	 problem	 solving.	
Assume	 that	 your console	 is	 a	 wall where	 the	 song	 will	 be	 written	 once	 your	
code	compiles	and	executes.

Goal:

Your	 repository	 must	 have	 two	 branches.	 One	 containing	 the	 stubbed	 version	 of	 the	
functions	 while	 the	 other	 containing	 implementation.	 You	 must	 also	 show	 ability	 to	
merge	these	branches	to	master	branch	for	releasing	the	code.
